# Bitasmbl-SomeTHING-ef80ef-b9bbb1a779c7

## Description
Build a web application that displays current weather, multi-day forecasts, and visualizes trends with charts. The project focuses on integrating APIs, dynamic front-end updates, and data visualization for an interactive user experience.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- ASP.NET Core
- Vue.js

## Requirements
- Fetch real-time weather data from a public API
- Display multi-day weather forecasts with clear UI elements
- Visualize temperature, humidity, or other metrics with charts
- Support user interactions, such as searching by city
- Optionally cache API responses to improve performance

## Installation
bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/he1snber8/Bitasmbl-SomeTHING-ef80ef-b9bbb1a779c7.git
cd Bitasmbl-SomeTHING-ef80ef-b9bbb1a779c7


## Usage
- Run backend services with FastAPI and/or ASP.NET Core.
- Serve the Vue.js frontend and open it in a browser.

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up FastAPI and ASP.NET Core projects.
2. Create Vue.js app and basic layout for weather views.
3. Integrate public weather API calls in the backend.
4. Expose endpoints for current weather and multi-day forecasts.
5. Connect Vue.js to backend endpoints for dynamic updates.
6. Add chart components to visualize weather metrics.
7. Implement city search interactions in the UI.
8. Add optional caching of API responses in the backend.
